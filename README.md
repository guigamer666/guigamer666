Hello! I'm Guillermo 👋

(Although on the internet I like to call myself "guigamer").
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a newcomer to the world of programming, but my curiosity for code started at a young age. I remember tinkering with game codes and creating mods as a child. While I pursued a degree in audiovisuals, I soon realized it wasn't my true passion. Now, I'm venturing into the vast universe of programming, eager to explore and learn.
🎮 Hobbies:

Growing up surrounded by computers and gaming consoles, my enthusiasm for video games was inevitable. I've been a gamer since I was a child. Apart from gaming, I'm passionate about technology, watching animes, and reading. I also enjoy setting up game servers with my group of friends. Music holds a special place in my heart, and I play the ukulele!
